## Goals
- Explore the possibilities of web based creative coding with p5js
- Bridge the gap between process and output

## Sessions
### 1. Drawing in the browser
_procedural mark making, iteration, oscillation, animation._

#### Goals
- Get everyones dev environments set up
- Discuss basics of javascript
  - How does it differ from ChucK, Processing, Arduino
      - Dynamic typing
      - Interpreted
  - How does javascript run in a browser ( what is index.html )
- How to make basic marks
  - Basic Shapes
  - color
  - Drawing over time ( background alpha )
- Animation 
  - moving objects with custom variables
  - moving objecs with frameCount
  - modulo
- Interation
  - translate, rotate, scale
  - push and pop
- Oscillation
  - sin and cos
  - phase calculation with map

#### Homework
- use the techniques discussed in class to create a perfectly looping animation
  - any number of frames

### 2. Interaction 
_mouse, keyboard, touch, walker based particle effects_

#### Goals
- Discuss user interaction with p5 callbacks
  - mouse
  - keyIsPressed
  - touch
  - acceleration
  - rotation
- create basic paintbrush effect with walkers and noise
- _time allowing:_ look at more general javascript callback syntax

#### Homework
- use the techniques discussed in class to create an interactive sketch
  - custom paintbrush effect
  - mobile sketch utilizing touch / acc / rot
  - something else of your choosing

### 2. Cellular Automata
---

Students willlearn the fundamentals of javascript as a graphics and animation tool, and how to use the browser as a canvas for unique, interactive art making. 
During this session we will discuss, 
(1) Drawing in the browser: procedural mark making, iteration, oscillation, and animation, 
(2) Interaction: mouse, keyboard, touch, and walker based paint effects, 
(3) Cellular automata: Wolfram CA, Conways game of life, and the Gray-Scott model of Reaction/Difusion, 
(4) Pixel Processing: procedural pixel manipulation for digital photography and video, 
(5) Particles: physics based particle effects, force simulation, randomness and chaos, 
(6) The DOM: interaction between HTML and javascript, utilizing external javascript libraries, displaying work online with github pages. Upon completion of the course, students will have created several browser based artworks, and will be able to display that work online through free hosting programs like Github pages, Gitlab pages, and dropbox
