  - Wolfram CA
  - Game of Life
    - Distortions
- Initial State Management
- More interesting rendering ideas

__Homework__  
Implement some drawing system discussed in class, or another of your choice. Try to push past just rendering the state of your system directly, the world doesn't need any more raw game of life simulations.

## Session 3 - 1/12/18 - Interaction
- Mouse
  - position
