### 3. Cellular Automata
_Wolfram CA, Conways game of life, and the Gray-Scott model of Reaction/Difusion_
__The output should be more than just the system__

#### Goals
- Understand simple cellular automata construction
- Use cellular automata state as a data set to display in interesting ways
- Build a system allowing non-traditional neighborhoods, weights 
- Disconnect update and display
- _time allowing:_ cellular automata performance vs flexibility
  - can we find a happy medium

#### Homework
Implement one of the cellular automata discussed in class (or something completely new) but with some variation in neighbor, weights, update, or display
