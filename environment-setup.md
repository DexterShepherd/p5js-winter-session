# Environment setup

There are many approaces to p5js development environments, but in this course we
will use the p5.js empty example project, an external text editor, and, when needed, 
a node.js server. We need to do a small amount of set up here, but it shouldn't 
be too painful. 

## Text editors
Although the files we are editing are essentially just text files, a good
programming focused text editor will make p5js development a much more enjoyable
experience. If you are familiar with processing, arduino, and ChucK you might be
used to editors and languages being tightly coupled together. In javascript this
is not the case so we must choose an editor to suite our development needs.

For the most part, the specific editor you use does not really matter. Any
programming text editor is sufficient for what we are doing. [Atom](atom.io) or
[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as good starting points.

## p5 folder
There are quite a few moving parts that need to be configured to get our p5 
sketches running properly, luckily we can download a preconfigured folder
[here](https://p5js.org/download/) and save ourselves some of the headache.
The download you are looking for is _p5.js complete_  

Download and unzip the _p5.js complete_ option and you should see a folder named
_p5_, open this folder and get familiar with the contents, this is where we will
do our programming for this course.

- _p5.js and p5.min.js files_  
These are the main p5.js library files. They contain the code the browser needs to understand
our sketches and render them properly. __Do not edit or remove these files__.

- _addons folder_  
This folder contains some supplemental javascript libraries that extend p5 to other domains,
namely sound generation, and DOM ( webpage ) interaction. __Do not edit or remove any of these files__.

- _Empty example folder_  
This is the folder we will duplicate each time we start a new sketch. 
  - _sketch.js_  
This is where we will write our p5js code
  - _index.html_  
This is the file the browser needs to get everything loaded and rendered correctly.
__Do not edit this file__.

_A note on folder structure_  
There is nothing magic about the directory structure here. The _index.html_ file
in the empty example folder ( and by extension all of your homework folders )
expects the _p5.js_ library file and the _addons_ folder to be one directory above it.
If you move one of your sketch folders to another location on your computer, 
without also copying the parent _p5_ folder with the _addons_, _p5.js_, and _p5.min.js_
files, it is likely things will break.


## Into the weeds? 
Undestanding the ins and outs of web development is not neccessary to use p5.js so
feel free to learn as much of this as interests you. However, some basic
knowledge of the main moving parts will be helpful in debugging some common
errors down the line.

When you navigate to a url, your browser will load the html file associated with that address,
in our case, that file _index.html_. The _index.html_ file is then responsible for loading any other assets or code that it needs to display properly. Our _index.html_ page will load _p5.min.js_ from our _libraries_ folder, and then our _sketch.js_ file. Once loaded, _sketch.js_ creates a`canvas` element on the page and starts running our p5.js code.
